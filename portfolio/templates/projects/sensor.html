	<p>This project was part of work that I did for Google's Summer of Code 2010. I worked together
		with a JavaScript consultant from Germany to design a sensor API plugin for the Dojo JavaScript
		framework.  I worked closely with my mentoring organization (Dojo Toolkit) 
		to develop a JavaScript API for accessing geolocation, accelerometer, and camera features on a 
		variety of mobile devices and platforms including PhoneGap, W3C compliant browsers, WebOS, Bondi, and JIL.
