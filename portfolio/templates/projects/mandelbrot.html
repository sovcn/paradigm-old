	This project was done as the final project for CPSC 474: Computer Architecture.  Roughly 1/3 of this
	course was dedicated to learning about parallel architectures: two of which are used extensively in
	this project (CUDA and OpenMP).  This research was presented at Slippery Rock University's annual
	student research symposium.

<p>
	The primary focus of this research was to develop a method for generating mandelbrot fractal images
	using both OpenMP and CUDA and to compare different aspects of their performance.  Additionally, a system
	for performing arbitrary precision calculations was developed and implemented on both parallel platforms.
